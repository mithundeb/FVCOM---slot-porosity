# FVCOM with slot-porosity

Here, we have modified some of the FVCOM 3.2 (http://fvcom.smast.umassd.edu/fvcom/) modules to incorporate a slot algorithm in the mass and momentum conservation equation to improve the tidal wetting and drying of wetland marsh surface. These modifications are done primarily to eliminate artificial ponding effects observed in hydrodynamic model simulations in any coastal salt marsh systems.
